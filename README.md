# QSSA
Simulation of QSSA and chiral QSSA

\texttt{run.m} calculates the success probability and run time for both standard and chiral QSSA for varying $N$. \texttt{runalpha.m} calculates the success probability and run time for chiral QSSA for fixed $N$ but varying $\alpha$. Instructions for all code are provided in files itself.
